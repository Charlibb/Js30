    // Differenc ebetwen reference and copy 

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = 100;
    console.log(age, age2); // output: 100, 100
    age = 200;  // not using let, just assigning new value to age
    console.log(age, age2); // output 200, 100

    // Value of "age" goes into the variable at the same time
     
   let name = "charli";
   let name2 = name

   console.log(name , name2); // charli , charli
   name = "nono";
   console.log(name , name2); // nono, charli

   let numberA = 555;
   let numberB = numberA;
   console.log(numberA, numberB);  // 555, 555
   numberA = 0;
   console.log(numberA, numberB);  // 0, 555

  

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
